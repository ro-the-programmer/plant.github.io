About
  </h1>
  <p>
On this site you'll be able to find various articles and other sites about plants, 
all for your reading pleasure. I've made this site to illustrate why plants matter,
 and why you should care. 
 Nowadays it can be easy to fall prey to doomerism, 
 but I say nay! 
 Our lives matter! 
 This world matters!
 And yes we can make a change!

Why are plants so important?
<div>
<h1>
Well first the obvious part, plants allow our existence. 
Without them our existence is impossible. 
This is because everything biological we eat, exists thanks to plants. 
Even the animals we eat, need to eat plants to survive. 
In fancy science-man terms, plants are heterotrophs, the basis of our ecosystem.
