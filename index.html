About
  </h1>
  <p>
On this site you'll be able to find various articles and other sites about plants, 
all for your reading pleasure. I've made this site to illustrate why plants matter,
 and why you should care. 
 Nowadays it can be easy to fall prey to doomerism, 
 but I say nay! 
 Our lives matter! 
 This world matters!
 And yes we can make a change!

<h1>
Why are plants so important?
</h1>
  <p>
Well first the obvious part, plants allow our existence. 
Without them our existence is impossible. 
This is because everything biological we eat, exists thanks to plants. 
Even the animals we eat, need to eat plants to survive. 
In fancy science-man terms, plants are heterotrophs, the basis of our ecosystem.
In addition they also do much much more than just feed us. 
Like how dunegrass allows the sand to stay still and allows us to build upon it. 
Or how we use the seeds of the cotton plant to make our clothes.
Or how plastics are made from fossil fuels, which guess what, come from ancient plants.
Or how paracetemol was first made with the bark of the white willow. 
Plants encompass everything in our world, it is part of us, and will remain so forever. 
Nearly every species tells a story, from how the hemlock was used to kill socrates,
 to the plant from which we have derived broccoli, kholrabi, kale, mustard and more.

  <h1>Kinds of plants</h1>
  <p>There are a lot of different kinds of plants. In this website we have a couple of pages about plants and provide information regarding their features.
    But before you go scouring the website you can have a little rant about plants!
    Firstly, plants are incredibly complex, like a swiss watch^2. 
    Most use light absorbed by chlorophyll located in chloroplasts which then, due to their pigment,
    split water into positively charged hydrogen and oxygen. 
    This hydrogen is as a sort of battery, it stores positives, unlike electric batteries which store negatives(electrons).
    Using this gradient the plant can achieve things like making more leaves and roots.
    This is a great oversimplification but explaining every part would take about an entire books worth of text.
    And this is just the beginning, plants get way more complex than this, they develop vascular systems, extra pigments, fruits, flowers, toxins and much more.
