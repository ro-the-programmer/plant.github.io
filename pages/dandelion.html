This often despised plant is in my opinion undeserving of its hate.
The dandelion is a small herbacious plant with flower that bears abundant nectar, 
sutaining the local pollinator species. 
Furthermore is capable is growing in places where most other species wither and die. 
Its leaves can endure being stepped on, and their seeds can travel remarkably far without the help of any insect.
Furthermore it can survive in poor soils, that are both too wet or too dry, all this allowed them to colonize the world along with humans.
Which is why it's so abundant. It has also been introduced in America as a food crop. 
It's also been used as a medicinal plant since at least the tenth century in the middle-east.
The dandelion can also been eaten, its leaves can be used in salads, and the roots can be dried and turned into a coffee substitution.
Be warned though, it tastes quite bitter, though when processed it is quite pleasant.
It is a versatile plant and there's a reason it's so abundant.

 The dandelion used to be a very popular plant, but now due to industrialisation it has massively decreased in popularity.
    Which I believe is a shame, so have a recipe showing its usefulness! (<a href="https://circulatingnow.nlm.nih.gov/2016/06/07/the-dandelion/#:~:text=Native%20to%20Asia%20and%20Europe,liver%20diseases%20and%20digestive%20problems">source</a>)

    Pick two quarts of dandelion blossoms (check for bugs!) and snip off the stem and collar. Rinse in cool water. Place dandelion petals in a large pan and cover with four quarts of water. Boil for twenty minutes. While boiling, cut two oranges and two lemons into small pieces and place into a bowl. Pour the hot liquid and petals over oranges and lemons. Allow the mixture to cool to room temperature. Add one yeast cake [equivalent to about 2-1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast (or one 1/4-ounce package)] and let stand for 48 hours. Strain mixture through cheesecloth, squeezing to remove juice. Return the mixture to a bowl and add three and one-half pounds of sugar. Stir well to dissolve. Pour liquid into a glass cider jug and cover with lid.  Gently screw on the lid. Let stand for six weeks. Strain and bottle. Age for about six months. Makes about five, four-fifths wine bottles.

    In conclusion, next time you see a dandelion, please don't look down upon it like a vile beast.
    Instead try to appreciate it for the many benefits it gives to the ecosystem, and maybe even try to take a bite(ONLY IF YOU'RE 100% CERTAIN!!!).
