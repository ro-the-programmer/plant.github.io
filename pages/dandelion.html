Dandelion, coming from the French dents de lion, meaning lion's teeth. 
This often despised plant is in fact undeserving of its hate.
The dandelion is a small herbacious plant with flower that bears abundant nectar, 
sutaining the local pollinator species. 
Furthermore is capable is growing in places where most other species wither and die. 
Its leaves can endure being stepped on, and their seeds can travel remarkably far without the help of any insect.
The dandelion can also been eaten, its leaves can be used in salads, and the roots can be dried and turned into a coffee substitution.
Be warned though, it tastes quite bitter, though when processed it is quite pleasant.

    I personally quite fancy dandelions, as you most likely can tell considering all my gloating.
    I remember once talking to my mum about the plant once, we were talking about the edibility of the plant.
    She told me that you shouldn't eat the 'milk' within the plant. 
    The milk in question is a sort of sap that also contains toxic compounds, including latex. 
    It's called milk because it looks incredibly similar to milk.

    In conclusion, next time you see a dandelion, please don't look down upon it like a vile beast.
    Instead try to appreciate it for the many benefits it gives to the ecosystem, and maybe even try to take a bite(ONLY IF YOU'RE 100% CERTAIN!!!).
