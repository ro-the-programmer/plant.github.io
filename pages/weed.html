            The Importance Of Weeds

        <p>
            Most people think that weeds are useless, that they should be exterminated. 
            However, if this were to happen it would be very bad. 
            This is because weeds are just like any other plant, but we simply view them as weeds due them getting in the way of our goals.
            If you look at the larger picture though, you can see that they are very important.
            For example weeds often serve the function of a pioneer species, like how in rocky environments they 
            break apart the rock, allowing other life to settle there.
            They also decrease local temperature, due to being specialized to absorb light(chlorophyll and all that).
            They also store water in themselves, preventing flooding and drought simultaniously.
            Furthermore they provide a habitat for local small animals such as bugs and spiders, and thus also birds.
            You might also think that weeds make buidlings and such decay faster, this is untrue, 
            weeds have it in their best interests to keep their habitat intact, so they actually reduce erosion and decay.

            Don't get me wrong though, some plants can be very harmful to the environment,
            like how in america kudu has strangled nearly every temperate ecosystem. 
            This is however caused by introducing non-native species to the environment, when the weeds are native, they benefit the ecosystem they are in.
