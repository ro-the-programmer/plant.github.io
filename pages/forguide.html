        Foraging can be incredibly dangerous and harmful to the environment, 
        but if done properly you can even help evironment and even get free food!
        This is why proper foraging is so important.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here are a few general rules regarding foraging:
    
    <ol>
        <li>Always be 100% certain of what you are a picking</li>
        <li>Only take bits of a plant, not the entirety</li>
        <li>Check if the plant is rare or protected</li>
        <li>Forage where it's allowed</li>
    </ol>
    With these rules most problems are avoided, and there are good reasons for these rules.
</p>
<p>
    Take rule 1, there are lots of plants, and thus also lots of plants that look alike. 
Some of these look a-likes can be deadly. 
Take the poison hemlock for example, it can kill you with just one leaf, but it looks nearly identical to wild parsley and carrot.
Many unexperienced foragers have died due to this mistake, and thus you should always properly research the plant first, or ask a local expert.
</p>
<p>
Rule 2 is to prevent overharvesting or picking important plants. 
There's a good reason that it's illegal in mnay countries to forage, this is to protect the wildlife.
Becauce there have been many times that plants have gone extinct due to overharvesting, 
and not because of some big company, but because of individuals that didn't realise the harm they were causing.
Take the himalayn yew for example, it has been overharvested for its medicinal qualities and currently nearly extinct.
</p>
<p>
Rule 3 exists for the same reason as 2, but this one exists to prevent harvesting from rare plants.
Often rare and common plants can look alike, which is also why proper identification is so essential.
The plants are protected for a reason, and if you care for the plants you should respect those protections.

</p>
<p>
    Rule 4 is just common sense, besides commiting a crime, it can often be harmful to the environment.
    Take a protected park for example, foraging there is illegal because human influence is deemed to be harmful.

        Which plants to pick
    </h1>
    <p>
        The best plants to pick are the ones that are easily identifiable, such as dandelion or sheep sorrel.
        Always make sure to look for look-alikes though, as some edible plants have incredibly minor differences from deadly plants.
        I recommend staying away from the parsley family, because one small mistake can mean death.
        To pick:
        <ul>
            <li>Dandelion </li>
            <li>Bittercress</li>
            <li>Yarrow</li>
            <li>Strawberry</li>
            <li>Blackberry</li>
        </ul>
        Not to pick:
        <ul>
            <li>Parsley</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
